# Randomizer
A collection of Python scripts to work on large data and process data from an excel file and to store results in a new excel file.
The project here deals with splitting (or breaking down) a given number into different random (equal or unequal) parts such that the sum of the random numbers is equal to the given original numbers.
There are multiple scripts for completing different constraints as required by the client (my professor in this case).
There is a lot of similarity between different scripts but the requirement for every problem statement was different and implemented as such.
